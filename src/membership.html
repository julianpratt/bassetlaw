              <h3>Attend our meetings</h3>
              <p>Most weeks, we meet on a Wednesday night from 7:30pm on platform 1 of Retford Station. Once a month we have a visiting speaker or arrange a trip. We have a library of books, magazines and DVDs to borrow. Members have a wide range of interests and skills including general railway history, detailed model making, traditional and modern electrical skills, and are more than willing to give advice and demonstrate techniques. It's a great way to learn and meet people with common interests.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>See our layouts and get involved</h3>
              <p>The society builds and operates layouts in a variety of scales. We have a large permanent OO gauge DC layout “Bassetfield”, which is available on club nights for members to run their trains.</p>
              <p>We also have a number of portable layouts, including a OO gauge DCC layout “Langbrook Junction”, an N gauge layout “Corebridge”, an O gauge layout “Idleford Town” and a TT layout “Taylors Trains”. At any given time, one of these will be up and operational, or being developed further. These portable layouts are also available for exhibitions. Members are encouraged to get involved and learn new modelling skills.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Membership</h3>
              <p>Full membership costs £60 a year. We encourage new members to come along for a few meetings before joining.</p>
              <p>Membership is open to anyone over 12 years of age, but anyone under 18 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or adult appointed by the parents when attending the club rooms or society event.</p>
